## Introduction

Email spam is a prevalent issue, and traditional rule-based methods for filtering spam are often ineffective against constantly evolving spam techniques. Machine learning offers a more adaptable approach to detecting spam by learning patterns and characteristics from labeled data.

This project leverages a machine learning model to classify incoming emails as spam or non-spam. The model is built using a popular machine learning algorithm and is trained on a labeled dataset of emails.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found at [link to dataset](https://example.com/dataset). It consists of a collection of labeled emails, where each email is tagged as either "spam" or "non-spam." The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

## Usage

To use this repository for email spam detection, follow these steps:

1. *Clone the Repository*: Clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-spam-detection.git
cd email-spam-detection


2. *Install Dependencies*: Install the required dependencies by following the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section.

3. *Train the Model*: Train the spam detection model using the steps outlined in the [Training](#training) section.

4. *Evaluate the Model*: Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset by following the steps in the [Evaluation](#evaluation) section.

5. *Deploy the Model*: If desired, deploy the trained model using the instructions provided in the [Deployment](#deployment) section.

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


2. Install the required packages:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Training

To train the email spam detection model, run the following command:

bash
python train.py --data_dir /path/to/training/data --model_output_path model.pkl


Adjust the `--data_dir` flag to point to the directory containing the training data and specify the `--model_output_path` to save the trained model.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model using the testing dataset:

bash
python evaluate.py --model_path model.pkl --test_data_dir /path/to/test/data


## Deployment

To deploy the trained model, you can integrate it into your desired email processing pipeline. An example deployment script is provided in the `deploy` directory.
